                    <p>Wall-E is a two-wheeled educational self balancing and line following robot developed by SRA-VJTI, 
                        designed to teach embedded robotics concepts to students .
                        taught and handled a crowd of 220+ students during the workshop still one of the best weekends i have had .
                        we manufactured and tested over 60 kits for the event it was crazy fun!

                    <h3>Proximity</h3>
                    <p>Proximity is a reinforcement learning project designed to train autonomous agents to play Trackmania using a custom Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) architecture. 
                        Built upon the Linesight environment, it focuses on fine-tuning discrete control policies to master a given map. The repository 
                        features a modular pipeline for experimenting with reward shaping, hyperparameter optimization, and real-time training metrics.</p>
